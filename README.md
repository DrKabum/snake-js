# snake-js

Just a little project for fun, trying to replicate the good ol' game Snake in vanilla JavaScript.

This is based on a course made on Scrimba.com but was pushed further : 

* Styled in a retro fashion, like if you were holding a (somewhat) colored Nokia 3310
* Compared to the course, some bugs are fixed :
** Apples now can't be generated in the snake when generated at the exact same spot as the previous apple that just got eaten
